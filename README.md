### **Mod BIOS `or` UEFI**

---

![ImageBIOS](BIOS.ico)

---

### **How Installation**

```
python app.py
```
**Note: Run as Administrator** 

---

**The benefit of a graphical interface for the `BIOS` `(GUI BIOS/UEFI)` or intermediate programs that facilitate entry into the `BIOS` without pressing the manufacturer's button is:**

---

**Ease of User Access:**
**Users don't need to remember the key combinations `(F2, F10, Del, Esc, etc.)` depending on each manufacturer. Simply pressing a `key` from within the system `(Windows/Linux)` allows them to access the `BIOS`.**

---

**Reducing Errors:**
**Some people waste time `rebooting` their devices multiple times because they didn't press the correct key. A `GUI` or direct option eliminates this problem.**

---

**Increased Security:**
**Login is done in an organized and secure manner through the system itself, not randomly based on speed or luck.**

---

**Unified Access:**
**Instead of each manufacturer having a different key combination, there is a universal method (for example, the `"Restart to UEFI"` option within `Windows` or within the software).**

---

**Ease of Access for Non-Technicians:**
**The average user doesn't need to know any terms or buttons; they simply select `"Advanced Settings" → "BIOS"` and proceed directly.**
